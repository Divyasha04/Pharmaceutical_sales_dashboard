# Pharmaceutical_sales_dashboard
Introduction
Datamatrix-ml Pharmaceuticals is one of the leading Pharmaceutical Manufacturing companies with a global presence.
Their Markets are divided into different regions across the world. One of those regions manages the German and Poland Markets.
Company does not sell directly to customers. Instead, they work with a couple of Distributors in all their regions.
They have an agreement with each distributor to share their Sales Data. This is to enable them to gain insights up to the retail level. This data is made available to them in CSV format.
Objectives
The firm has asked us to perform in-depth data analysis to get insight into company sales performance. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) [pandas]
To understand, be familiar with and check the sanity of the given data, the first step is EDA. This project's initial data exploration has been carried out using the pandas python package. Here, in general, we are checking...

Presence of any missing values
Any unusual value (outliers)
Incorrect values (e.g., sales column, we see -ve numbers)
Determine categorical and numeric columns
Determine dimensions of categorical columns and range of numeric columns Note that these steps can be performed using PowerQuery Editor and/or excel; however, pandas makes it much easier and faster; on top of that, pandas can handle massive datasets.
EDA steps can be found in the .ipynb notebook.
Data Cleaning and Transform [PowerQuery Editor]
The provided dataset was relatively clean and well organized; hence only a little work was required in this step; the following steps were carried out...

Correct column heading provided
Correct data type is assigned to columns
Report Creation [PowerBI Desktop]
Three interactive reports/dashboards (report pages) will be created to implement the proposed solution.
1. Executive Summary Report [DM-DA01-SOL-1]
This high-level report shows the overall sales figures and elements at a glance.
